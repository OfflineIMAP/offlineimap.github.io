--dry-run
</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
  Run in dry run mode.
</p><p class="simpara">Do not actually modify any store but check and print what synchronization
actions would be taken if a sync would be performed. It will not precisely
give the exact information what will happen. If e.g. we need to create a
folder, it merely outputs <span class="emphasis"><em>Would create folder X</em></span>, but not how many and which
mails it would transfer.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">
--info
</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
  Output information on the configured email repositories.
</p><p class="simpara">Useful for debugging and bug reporting. Use in conjunction with the ‘-a’ option
to limit the output to a single account. This mode will prevent any actual sync
to occur and exits after it output the debug information.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">
-1
</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
  Limit multithreading operations and run solely a single-thread sync.
</p><p class="simpara">This effectively sets the <span class="emphasis"><em>maxsyncaccounts</em></span> and all <span class="emphasis"><em>maxconnections</em></span> configuration

-P &lt;directory&gt;
</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
  Set OfflineIMAP into profile mode.
</p><p class="simpara">The program will create DIR (it must not already exist).  As it runs, Python
profiling information about each thread is logged into profiledir. Please
note: This option is present for debugging and optimization only, and should
NOT be used unless you have a specific reason to do so. It will significantly
decrease program performance, may reduce reliability, and can generate huge
amounts of data. This option implies the ‘-1’ option.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">
-a &lt;account1[,account2[,…]]&gt;

  Enables debugging for OfflineIMAP.
</p><p class="simpara">This is useful if you are to track down a malfunction or figure out what is
going on under the hood. This option requires one or more debugtypes,
separated by commas. These define what exactly will be debugged, and so far
include options: "imap", "thread", "maildir" or "ALL". The imap option will enable
IMAP protocol stream and parsing debugging. Note that the output may contain
passwords, so take care to remove that from the debugging output before
sending it to anyone else. The maildir option will enable debugging for
certain Maildir operations.  The use of any debug option (unless "thread" is
included), implies the single-thread option ‘-1’.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">

</p><p class="simpara">If "section" is omitted, it defaults to "general". Any underscores in the
section name are replaced with spaces: for instance, to override option
"autorefresh" in the "[Account Personal]" section in the config file one would
use ‘-k Account_Personal:autorefresh=30’. Repeat this option as much as
necessary to redefine multiple options.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">

and we have the message locally, it will be left untouched in a quick run. This
option is ignored if maxage is set.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">
-u &lt;UI&gt;
</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
  Specifies an alternative user interface to use.

that might not be the best performing one. Once you got everything set up and
running, you might want to look into speeding up your synchronization. Here
are a couple of hints and tips on how to achieve this.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
Synchronize more than one account.
</p><p class="simpara">By default we only use one connection to an IMAP server. Using 2 or even 3
speeds things up considerably in most cases.  In order to synchronize more than
one account concurrently, consider starting one instance of offlineimap per
account.</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10%;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>enabling the <span class="emphasis"><em>maxsyncaccounts</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>maxconnections</em></span> options is
deprecated since it’s known to have race conditions.</p></div></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
Use folderfilters.
</p><p class="simpara">The quickest sync is a sync that can ignore some folders. I sort my inbox into
monthly folders, and ignore every folder that is more than 2-3 months old,
this lets me only inspect a fraction of my Mails on every sync. If you haven’t
done this yet, do it :). See the <span class="emphasis"><em>folderfilter</em></span> section in <span class="emphasis"><em>offlineimap.conf</em></span>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
The sqlite cache.
</p><p class="simpara">OfflineImap caches the state of the synchronisation to e.g. be able to determine
if a mail has been added or deleted on either side.</p><p class="simpara">The historical status cache is a plain text file that writes out the complete
file for each single new message (or even changed flag) to a temporary file. If
you have plenty of files in a folder, this is a few hundred kilo to megabytes
for each mail and is bound to make things slow. The latest status cache
is sqlite. This saves plenty of disk activity. The sqlite engine and the Python
sqlite module must be installed. The historical plain status cache is not
supported anymore.</p><p class="simpara">If you switch the backend from plain to sqlite, you may want to delete the old
cache directory in <span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;metadata&gt;/Account-&lt;account&gt;/LocalStatus</em></span> manually (the
sqlite cache stands in the <span class="emphasis"><em>LocalStatus-sqlite</em></span> folder).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
Use quick sync.
</p><p class="simpara">A regular sync will request all flags and all UIDs of all mails in each folder
which takes quite some time. A quick sync only compares the number of
messages in a folder on the IMAP side (it will detect flag changes on the
Maildir side of things though). A quick sync on my smallish account will take
7 seconds rather than 40 seconds. E.g. run a cron script that does a regular
sync once a day, and does quick syncs ‘-q’ only synchronizing the ‘-f INBOX’
in between.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
Turn off fsync.
</p><p class="simpara">In the <span class="emphasis"><em>[general]</em></span> section you can set fsync to <span class="emphasis"><em>True</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>False</em></span>. If you want to
play 110% safe and wait for all operations to hit the disk before continuing,
you can set this to True. If you set it to False, you lose some of that
safety, trading it for speed.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="refsect1"><a id="_security_and_ssl"></a><h2>Security and SSL</h2><p>By default, OfflineIMAP will connect using any method that <span class="emphasis"><em>openssl</em></span> supports,
that is SSLv2, SSLv3, or TLSv1.</p><p>Do note that SSLv2 is notoriously insecure and deprecated.  Unfortunately,
python2 does not offer easy ways to disable SSLv2. It is recommended you test
your setup and make sure that the mail server does not use an SSLv2
connection. Use e.g. "openssl s_client -host mail.server -port 443" to find
out the connection that is used by default.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
Certificate checking
</p><p class="simpara">Unfortunately, by default we will not verify the certificate of an IMAP
TLS/SSL server we connect to, so connecting by SSL is no guarantee against
man-in-the-middle attacks. While verifying a server certificate checking the
fingerprint is recommended. There is currently only one safe way
to ensure that you connect to the correct server in an encrypted manner: you
can specify a <span class="emphasis"><em>sslcacertfile</em></span> setting in your repository section of
offlineimap.conf pointing to a file that contains (among others) a CA
Certificate in PEM format which validating your server certificate. In this
case, we will check that:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
The server SSL certificate is validated by the CA Certificate.
</li><li class="listitem">
The server host name matches the SSL certificate.

StartTLS
</p><p class="simpara">If you have not configured your account to connect via SSL anyway, OfflineImap
will still attempt to set up an SSL connection via the STARTTLS function, in
case the imap server supports it.</p><p class="simpara">There is no certificate or fingerprint checking involved at all, when using
STARTTLS (the underlying imaplib library does not support this yet). This
means that you will be protected against passively listening eavesdroppers and
they will not be able to see your password or email contents. However, this
will not protect you from active attacks, such as Man-In-The-Middle attacks
which cause you to connect to the wrong server and pretend to be your mail
server.</p><p class="simpara"><span class="strong"><strong>DO NOT RELY ON STARTTLS AS A SAFE CONNECTION GUARANTEEING THE AUTHENTICITY OF

Sharing a maildir with multiple IMAP servers.
</p><p class="simpara">Generally a word of caution mixing IMAP repositories on the same Maildir root.
You have to be careful that you <span class="strong"><strong>never</strong></span> use the same maildir folder for 2 IMAP
servers. In the best case, the folder MD5 will be different, and you will get
a loop where it will upload your mails to both servers in turn (infinitely!)
as it thinks you have placed new mails in the local Maildir. In the worst
case, the MD5 is the same (likely) and mail UIDs overlap (likely too!) and it
will fail to sync some mails as it thinks they are already existent.</p><p class="simpara">I would create a new local Maildir Repository for the Personal Gmail and
use a different root to be on the safe side here. You could e.g. use</p><pre class="literallayout">`~/mail/Pro' as Maildir root for the ProGmail and
`~/mail/Personal' as root for the personal one.</pre><p class="simpara">If you then point your local mutt, or whatever MUA you use to ‘~/mail/’

Edge cases with maxage causing too many messages to be synced.
</p><p class="simpara">All messages from at most maxage days ago (+/- a few hours, depending on
timezones) are synced, but there are cases in which older messages can also be
synced. This happens when a message’s UID is significantly higher than those of
other messages with similar dates, e.g. when messages are added to the local
folder behind offlineimap’s back, causing them to get assigned a new UID, or
when offlineimap first syncs a pre-existing Maildir. In the latter case, it
